# Research & Projects

Our chapter is involved in a range of research activities, including:

- **Honeypot Deployment:** Setting up and monitoring honeypots to collect data on emerging cyber threats.
- **Threat Analysis:** Investigating attack vectors and publishing findings similar in style to the "Know Your Enemy" papers.
- **Collaborative Projects:** Partnering with local and international cybersecurity groups to enhance our research capabilities.

We continually update our projects and methodologies to address the evolving cybersecurity landscape.
