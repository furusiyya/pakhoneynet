# Research

This page details the research activities and focus areas of our chapter.

## Current Research

Our chapter is currently focusing on the following research areas:

### Glutton Honeypot Development
We are investigating advanced protocol emulation techniques to enhance Glutton's capabilities as a versatile honeypot solution. This research is led by Muhammad Bilal Arif and aims to create more convincing decoys that can capture sophisticated attack patterns and techniques. Our work includes developing and testing new protocol handlers, improving logging mechanisms, and creating analysis tools to better understand captured attack data.

### Threat Intelligence Collection and Analysis
This project explores methods for effectively collecting and analyzing threat intelligence data gathered from our honeypot deployments. We're utilizing data visualization techniques and machine learning algorithms to identify attack patterns, attribution markers, and emerging threats. Our goal is to develop actionable intelligence that can benefit the broader security community.

### Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
We are working on comprehensive documentation for honeypot deployment, configuration, and analysis. This includes creating beginner-friendly guides, technical deep-dives, and best practices documentation. Our aim is to lower the barrier to entry for organizations wanting to deploy honeypot technologies as part of their security infrastructure.

## Planned Publications

- **Glutton - A Versatile Protocol-Agnostic Honeypot** (Planned for 2025)
  We are currently preparing a detailed paper on Glutton, following the Honeynet Project's "Know Your Tool" series format. This publication will provide an in-depth technical overview of Glutton's architecture, deployment scenarios, and analysis capabilities. The paper will include case studies of attacks captured in the wild and practical guidance for security researchers and organizations.

- **Regional Threat Landscape Report** (Planned for 2026)
  Based on data collected from our honeypot deployments, we plan to publish an analysis of the regional threat landscape, highlighting attack trends, techniques, and threat actor behaviors specific to our region.

## Ongoing Collaborations

We are actively collaborating with other Honeynet Project chapters and academic institutions to share data, methodologies, and findings. These collaborations enhance our research capabilities and contribute to the global understanding of cyber threats.

## Future Research Directions

- Advanced attacker interaction simulation
- Multi-honeypot correlation techniques
- Automated incident response based on honeypot intelligence
- Integration of honeypot data with SOAR platforms
