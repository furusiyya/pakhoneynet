# Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

The Honeynet Project has been participating in Google Summer of Code since 2009. We, the Pakistan Chapter, want to do our part in contributing to innovative projects and mentoring students in cybersecurity.

Bilal Arif, our Chapter Lead, is a GSoC alum, and this year (2025), he is also mentoring a project. You can look up details [here](https://www.honeynet.org/gsoc/gsoc-2025/google-summer-of-code-2025-project-ideas/#implementing-protocol-parsers-for-glutton-using-spicy).
